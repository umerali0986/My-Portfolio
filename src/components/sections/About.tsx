              My Journey in Software Development
            </h3>
            
            <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              <p>I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a solid foundation in web application design, development, testing, and maintenance. My journey began when I was studying for my Bachelor's degree in computer science, when I realized my passion for coding. Since then, there has been something deep down in me that is very eager to become a software developer, which has led me to specialize in my career as a software developer.</p>
              
              <p>Skilled in building responsive and scalable web applications using Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and modern frameworks, with practical knowledge in developing REST APIs and user interfaces. A collaborative team player with hands-on experience in agile environments, testing automation, and delivering solutionsthat make a difference.Â What excites me most about development is the opportunity to transform ideas into reality, creating applications that solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.</p>
              
              <p>I believe in continuous learning and staying ahead of the curve in this ever-evolving field. Currently seeking a Junior Software Developer role to implement my technical and soft skills at a company while ensuring that I deliver solutions that not only meet current standards but also anticipate future needs.</p>
